# Sales & Products SQL Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project showcases **intermediate-level SQL querying skills** by analyzing sales and product data stored in a relational database. The queries are designed to answer common **business and reporting questions** such as total sales volume, average pricing by category, daily revenue trends, high-performing products, sales classification, and price-based product segmentation.

## 🗂 Database Context

**Database:** `task`

### Tables Used

* **sales** – contains transactional sales records
* **products** – contains product details and pricing information

---

## 🧠 Business Questions & SQL Solutions

### Question 1: Total products sold

Calculates the total quantity of products sold across all transactions.

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_product
FROM sales;
```

---

### Question 2: Average product price by category

Finds the average price of products per category and orders the result from highest to lowest.

```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS Avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY Avg_price DESC;
```

---

### Question 3: Daily revenue analysis

Computes total revenue per day by multiplying quantity and unit price.

```sql
SELECT sale_date,
       ROUND(SUM(quantity * unit_price), 0) AS Daily_Revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

---

### Question 4: High-volume products

Identifies products that have sold more than 10 units in total.

```sql
SELECT product_id,
       SUM(quantity) AS Total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING Total_quantity > 10;
```

---

### Question 5: Sales size classification

Classifies each sale as **Large**, **Medium**, or **Low** based on quantity sold using a `CASE` statement.

```sql
SELECT sale_id,
       quantity,
       CASE
         WHEN quantity >= 10 THEN 'Large Sales'
         WHEN quantity BETWEEN 5 AND 9 THEN 'Medium Sales'
         ELSE 'Low Sales'
       END AS size_category
FROM sales
ORDER BY quantity DESC;
```

---

### Question 6: Price-based product segmentation

Segments products into price groups using a `UNION` operation.

```sql
SELECT product_name, category, 'Price > 100' AS price_group
FROM products
WHERE price > 100
UNION
SELECT product_name, category, 'Price < 50' AS price_group
FROM products
WHERE price < 50;
```

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
* Grouping and filtering (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Conditional logic with `CASE`
* Sorting results using `ORDER BY`
* Combining result sets with `UNION`
* Business-focused data analysis
